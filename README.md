### Hi, I'm Bhuvanesh.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Sprinklr](https://www.sprinklr.com/), specializing in optimizing Large Language Models for large-scale deployment. I work on Agentic Workflows and extracting insights from vast amounts of data using LLMs — all while keeping hallucinations in check.

I graduated from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I worked across Deep Reinforcement Learning, Graph Networks, and Computer Vision — with a particular focus on tackling inverse problems in computational chemistry using ML.

I write more at **[bhuvanesh09.github.io](https://bhuvanesh09.github.io)** — short musings and longer treatises on things that hold my attention long enough.

#### Publications

A few papers from my time at IIIT Hyderabad — mostly at the intersection of ML and molecular science:

- [Modern ML for tackling inverse problems in chemistry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Yy5C2PQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Yy5C2PQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) — *Chemical Communications, 2022*
- [Deep RL for molecular structure prediction from NMR spectra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Yy5C2PQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Yy5C2PQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C) — *J. Phys. Chem. Letters, 2022*
- [DeepSPInN — multimodal structure prediction from IR and NMR](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Yy5C2PQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Yy5C2PQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C)

#### Find me

For my latest takes on ML, LLMs, and whatever else I'm thinking about, I'm most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_bhuvanesh_) — that's the best place to reach me.

*Outside of work, I enjoy go-karting and consider myself pretty good at it. If you're up for a challenge, let's race.*
